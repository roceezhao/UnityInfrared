This GPU shader mimics images from IR cameras. It allows you to specify the temperature range of each scene object, and use a texture to show temperature variations. Manipulation of each objects temperature range allows heat up and cool down effects. Shaders are managed by C# scripts that are easy to communicate with from your own code.

Contents of this projects should be placed in a folder called `Infrared` within your `Assets` folder.
